      "Pour this mixture in a nonstick pan & cook it over medium to low flame until it gets pasty & translucent, you will have to keep stirring the mixture continuously, this process will take upto 4-5 minutes.",
      "Once the mixture turns translucent add it into the mold carefully, use a napkin to hold the mold, fill it sufficiently & then pipe the mixture out using the mold directly over the ice bath, the falooda sev will set once it touches the ice-cold water, you can repeat the process with the remaining mixture & if the mixture gets cold you can reheat it in the pan while stirring it continuously.",
      "Let the falooda sev rest in the ice-cold water for 30 minutes. After that your falooda sev will be ready.",
      "To make mango puree, add the chopped mangos in a mixer grinder jar & blend it into a fine puree, remove ½ a cup of puree aside to use it while plating.",
      "In the same mixer grinder jar with the remaining mango puree add the condensed milk & milk, blend it well until all the ingredients combine.",
      "Your mango flavoured thick milk is ready, put it in the fridge & serve it chilled.",
      "For assembly: layer falooda sev, soaked sabja, mangoo pure, mango flavoured milk. You can top it up with some ice cream or kulfi"

      "Wash the toor dal well & soak it in fresh water for 30 minutes to an hour.",

      "Place a steel bowl over the dal in the cooker & add the peanuts into the bowl, put the cooker’s lid on & cook the dal over medium high flame for 2-3 whistles, then switch off the flame & let the cooker de-pressurize.",
      "Once de-pressurized open the lid, remove the peanuts & set them aside, then blend the dal using a blender, your boiled toor dal is ready.",
      "Now to temper the dal set a deep pan or a stock pot over high flame & once it gets hot add in the ghee and oil mix & let it heat as well.",
      "Once the ghee gets hot add the cumin seeds, mustard seeds, cloves, cinnamon, red chillies, fenugreek seeds, hing, curry leaves, chopped tomato, ginger chilli paste & salt to taste, stir & cook over high flame until the tomatoes get slightly mushy.",
      "Further add turmeric powder & kashmiri red chilli powder, stir quickly & add the boiled dal, stir well & add hot water to adjust the consistency of the dal, make sure to keep the dal a little watery at this stage as its going to simmer for a while you will be making the dhoklis.",
      "Add the boiled peanuts, jaggery & tamarind pulp, stir well & set the flame to medium low, let the dal simmer until you prepare the dhoklis.",
      "In a large bowl add wheat flour, gram flour,salt as per taste,hing,carom seeds,turmeric 1/2 tsp,kashmiri chilli powder 1/2 tsp along with the oil & mix everything well.",
      "Further add water as required to make a semi-soft dough, the dough should be of the same stiffness as a puri/chapati dough.",
      "Once you have kneaded the dough, cover it with a damp cloth for 10-15 minutes.",
      "Divide the dough into 2 portions once rested, coat one portion with dry flour & roll it into a large chapati, it shouldn’t be too thick or too thin.",
      "Further cut the chapati into squares, diamonds or strips using a pizza cutter or a knife, diamonds shape is more preferable",
      "Cut the second portion similarly & your dhoklis will be ready to be added into the dal.",
      "Check the dal that has been simmering, taste & adjust accordingly, Add tablespoon of both tamarind pulp & jaggery, stir well & bring the dal to a boil before adding the dhoklis or else the dhoklis will stick to each other when you add them in the dal.",
      "Once the dal comes to a boil, add the all the cut dhoklis carefully & then gently stir them into the dal.",
      "Cover the pan with a lid & cook over medium low flame for 10 - 15 minutes.",
      "Once cooked, remove the lid, you will see that the dal has thickened up a bit & the dhoklis will have fluffed up.",
      "Add some freshly chopped coriander & stir well.",
      "Your dal dhokli is ready, add ghee & lemon juice over the dal while serving along with crispy papads."
